Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research)

## What is Bitsong?
BitSong is an open source blockchain born in December 2017. Bitsong's mission is to simplify the music bureaucracy as much as possible, make the artists independent and facilitate the management of royalties.
Based on Cosmos-SDK/Tendermint, BitSong is an interoperable and cross-chain blockchain.
Through the BitSong api, any user can build their own decentralized music player and/or manage their royalties.

- Bitsong Network is a project whereby artists can tokenize their productions, receive new investments for their new productions and share their rewards with all their fans.
- Thanks to blockchain technology, each stream will be recorded and impossible to modify.
- BitSong is a new music platform, which is built using [Cosmos-SDK] (https://cosmos.network) and the distributed IPFS filesystem.
- Your music will be distributed via BitSong on all its clients. For each track listened, you will receive a real-time $BTSG reward the token that is used to secure the network.

- Distributed governance means that there is no element that can make decisions independently.

## How to obtain BTSG tokens?
- Currently Bitsong is running an [incentivized testnet](https://medium.com/@BitSongOfficial/how-to-participate-in-bitsong-testnet-4-incentivized-e5987bfc9d10
) and Mainnet 1.0 will be going live upon successful completion. 
With the launch of Mainnet 1.0 Bitsong will enable:
    - Bank transfer
    - Governance
    - Staking
The goal of this testnet-4 is testing the sdk 0.39.1 the official release that we will use for Mainnet 1.0.
**ERC20 and Liquidity Pool**
In the meantime Bitsong still have the ERC20 token, users who want to partecipate to the staking and governance can swap the token from ERC20 to the native token before the launch.
- After Mainnet launch, users can continue to swap the token in a decentralized or centralized way
- Until  Mainnet 2.0 they plan to keep our token only on DEX.

## A list of Bitsong wallets
- Once on mainnet the list of wallets supporting Bitsong will be updated. Stay tuned!

## A step-by-step staking guide
