## What is Bitsong?
- Bitsong Network is a project whereby artists can tokenize their productions, receive new investments for their new productions and share their rewards with all their fans.
- Thanks to blockchain technology, each stream will be recorded and impossible to modify.
- BitSong is a new music platform, which is built using [Cosmos-SDK] (https://cosmos.network) and the distributed IPFS filesystem.
- Your music will be distributed via BitSong on all its clients. For each track listened, you will receive a real-time $BTSG reward the token that is used to secure the network.

## How to obtain BTSG tokens?
- Currently Bitsong is running an [incentivized testnet](https://medium.com/@BitSongOfficial/how-to-participate-in-bitsong-testnet-4-incentivized-e5987bfc9d10
) and Mainnet 1.0 will be going live upon successful completion. 
With the launch of Mainnet 1.0 Bitsong will enable:
    - Bank transfer
    - Governance
    - Staking
The goal of this testnet-4 is testing the sdk 0.39.1 the official release that we will use for Mainnet 1.0.
