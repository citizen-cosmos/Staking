# Cosmos

Always DYOR (do your own research)

## What is Cosmos?
Cosmos is an ecosystem of connected blockchains or the internet of blockchains. It is the TCP/IP of web3. A truly decentralized communication protocol. Cosmos hub is the first hub and blockchain in that ecosystem. ATOM is the main token of Cosmos. It is used to help secure the network, transact, participate in governance and can be staked to receive rewards.

Cosmos is an interoperable blockchain protocol that facilitates the transfer of data between existing chains. It operates via a hub-and-spoke model that leverages the design elements of other chains to enable cross-chain interaction. The Cosmos framework features a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm developed by Tendermint to secure the protocol.

In simpler words with Cosmos you can transfer any data, not just tokens. Think of a big complicated Excel table, not one but many. Think of macros. Remember when you had to connect one excel table to another and then when you made changes in one cell, it changed in the other table? Pretty much the same thing works here. But using blockchain technology, a trsutless setup and a consensus protocol that makes sure everything is secure and works as per planned.

Often the Cosmos ecosystem, Cosmos hub, Cosmos-SDK, ATOM and Tendermint are mixed and confused. Cosmos is the overall name for everything described above. The technology. It is also the name of the first hub and blockchain using that tech. Cosmos-SDK is the toolkit that allows anyone to build blockchains easily out of the box. Tendermint is the engine that makes it all work under the hood and ATOM is the token of the Cosmos hub, not the ecosystem. There are many chains in the ecosystem, and they talk to each other via IBC, each has its own token/s and can have other chains connected to it, hence, making it a hub too.

## How to obtain ATOM tokens?
You can purchase them on a centralized exchange. The list of such exchanges can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos#markets). Or, you can purchase them using a DEX or a swap service. Please find a list of such services [here](https://github.com/serejandmyself/cryptowiki/blob/master/cryptowiki.md#no-kycaml). Note, that not all these services have ATOM.

For beginners we advise to either use [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/ATOM_BTC) or something like [Simpleswap](https://simpleswap.io/). Please be caution when using any service listed above and do your own due diligence first. Always and always test the service first for small sums and if it's ok, then, do your transaction/s.

## A list of Cosmos wallets
The best way to store ATOM, or in fact, any other token, is using a hardware device like Ledger or Trezor. We understand that not everyone has the ability to purchase those, although we strongly encourage this. A device like this costs 50-200 USD and if your crypto holding exceed that sum, it makes perfect sense to secure your holdings. Purchase such device only from verified vendors and official re-sellers! A list of these can always be found on the official website of the device in question.

You can always find a community maintained list of Cosmos wallets [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/delegators-cosmos-tendermint-guides-wallets-explorers-tools/2168). If you don't have a Ledger, the easiest wallet to use is the [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) extension for your desktop, or [Cosmostation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wannabit.io.cosmostaion) on your mobile device. Save your seed on paper and backup your login password twice. Do not store your seed online!

If you do have a Ledger, then you can also use [Cosmstation](https://www.cosmostation.io/), to which you just connect your Ledger and start using it.

## A step-by-step staking guide
Staking ATOM is easy as 1,2,3. It really is. Let's go thorough 2 options:

1) You know what you're doing and how to delegate. Then simply use [our validator address: ]() and delegate!

2) You're using [Keplr](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Staking/blob/main/Cosmos.md#keplr), [Cosmostation](https://github.com/citizen-cosmos/Staking/blob/main/Cosmos.md#cosmostation) or any other wallet. It doesn't really matter. They all work more or less the same. The idea is that you need to find the 'reward' or the 'validator' tab and then delegate the desired amount.

#### Keplr
Open Keplr, make sure you have some balance and click the blue 'stake' button, this will open a new browser window in which you will see the list of the current, active validators. Make sure that on the left menu, 'Cosmos' is selected (just under the Keplr logo). Find Citizen Cosmos and click 'manage':

A new window will appear. Make sure it says Citizen Cosmos and click 'delegate':

Input the desired amount you wish to delegate and click 'delegate':

#### Cosmostation
Let's say your using Cosmostation. Connect your Ledger, input your pin and open the Cosmos app. Open a browser window and the [Cosmostation app](). Click on the big 'Connect wallet' button in the middle of the screen. You will be prompted to select your device, do so and click 'connect'.

Click 'Reward' on the left:

You will arrive at a page with a list of the validators. Find Citizen Cosmos and click 'delegate'. A window will appear:

Choose the amount you wish to delegate and click 'sign transaction'. You will be prompted with another window:

Make sure the info is correct and sign (approve) the transaction on your device.
